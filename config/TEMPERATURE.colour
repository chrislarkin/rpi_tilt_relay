#Temperature Calibration file for Tilt Hydrometer
#To be active, the file should be named TEMPERATURE.<colour> in the tileHydrometer/ folder
#and have at least one calibration value inside.
#So to calibrate a red tilt hydrometer, the file would be called TEMPERATURE.red
#The following example one calibration points are used. 
#16.5C read from the tilt hydrometer will be calibrated to the actual value of 15C
#Farenheight values could also be used if the TiltHydrometerManager is set to work in Farenheight
#Other calibration points will be calculated.

#Original Value, Actual Value
16.5, 15
