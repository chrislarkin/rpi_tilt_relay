#Gravity Calibration file for Tilt Hydrometer
#To be active, the file should be named GRAVITY.<colour> in the tiltHydrometer/ folder
#and have at least one calibration value inside.
#So to calibrate a black tilt hydrometer, the file would be called GRAVITY.black
#The following example two calibration points are used. 
#0.997 read from the tilt hydrometer will be calibrated to the actual value of 0.999
#1.056 read from the tilt hydrometer will be calibrated to the actual value of 1.060
#Other calibration points will be calculated.

#Original SG Value, Calibrated Value
